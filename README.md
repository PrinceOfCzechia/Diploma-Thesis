This repository stores the (mostly R) code accompanying my master's thesis.
The prerequisites are the following R packages:
+ dplyr
+ cmdstanr
+ brms
and the data from the PRO-ACT database.
These cannot be shared by me, but anyone can request access at the database [website](https://ncri1.partners.org/ProACT/Home/Index).
